Something learned after mentorship events in the past few weeks:

1. Startup is not only about make the best technology, but more importantly solving the *pain points* of the customers.

2. And in order to know the pain points of the customers, you really need to *talk to your users* to understand their needs.

3. Practice make prefect, especially with your *pitch*

4. KISS

5. Build connections in everywhere at anytime (including [here][1])

6. To be added
